    content: 'TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing.',
    longContent: 'TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. By adding optional static typing, TypeScript helps developers catch errors at compile time, improving code quality and maintainability. It supports various types including primitive types (number, string, boolean), object types (arrays, tuples, enums), and advanced types (generics, union/intersection types). TypeScript integrates seamlessly with modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries, and its tooling offers features like autocompletion, type checking, and refactoring. With TypeScript, developers can write more robust and scalable code while still utilizing JavaScript’s dynamic capabilities.',

It employs a component-based architecture, where each component represents a part of the UI with its own state and behavior. React introduces JSX, a syntax extension that allows mixing HTML with JavaScript, which makes the code more readable and easier to write. React’s virtual DOM efficiently updates the actual DOM by diffing changes and applying only the necessary updates. The library’s ecosystem includes tools like React Router for navigation and Redux for state management, facilitating the development of complex, interactive web applications.',

A promise has three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. Promises allow you to write asynchronous code that is cleaner and more manageable compared to traditional callback-based approaches. They provide methods like `.then()` for handling successful outcomes, `.catch()` for handling errors, and `.finally()` for cleanup actions. Promises are the foundation for modern asynchronous programming in JavaScript, and they work seamlessly with async/await syntax, which provides a more synchronous-looking code structure while maintaining non-blocking behavior.',
